Scripts relating to things I run at home.

The primary script in here is encode-recording.pl, meant to work with the MythTV
database, and be called as a userjob from MythTV. For me, this archives the content
over to plex, and I'm in the process of supporting more shows with the auto-sort
and making the script. Eventually the script will work with any season / episode
combination and make folders on my output path as needed.
